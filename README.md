# Mosaico

Mosaico (From the Italian translation of Mosaic) is a charting library inspired by [D3js](https://github.com/d3) but
built on new standards (native typescript, workspaces, etc.), and with a focus on:

- Performance.
- Atomocity instead of having a single interface to do everything.
- New web standards (SVG 2.0 and Canvas).

## Key differences from D3js

Mosaico approach is to have first class support for both SVGs and Canvas and should be designed to work both client and
server side.

## What Mosaico is

### What Mosaico IS NOT
